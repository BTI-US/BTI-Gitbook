## Cryptocurrency Products

Cryptocurrency products often carry high investment risks, and the regulatory status of such products is still unclear in many jurisdictions. Therefore, any losses related to the trading of $BTI tokens may not be subject to regulatory relief or recourse. The value of $BTI tokens may fluctuate dramatically, and there is even a risk of complete loss. In addition, the technical infrastructure underlying the BTI platform, including $BTI tokens themselves, remains experimental, and the stable operation of the network cannot be guaranteed.

Before participating, we strongly recommend that you visit our website for more detailed information and a deeper understanding of the potential risks involved. You should be aware that your place of residence may have specific restrictions on the holding, purchase, or sale of $BTI tokens, and you are responsible for ensuring that your actions comply with local laws and regulations.

## Token Features

The BTI platform has introduced its own native digital cryptographic security utility token, the $BTI token, which plays a crucial role in the operation of the platform. The design of the $BTI token aims to make it a transaction currency, community reward mechanism, governance tool, and a means of risk management and asset appreciation on the platform. This innovative initiative aims to support the functionality of the platform comprehensively while enhancing the participation and experience quality of the entire user community.

The introduction of the $BTI token not only provides platform users with a new means of payment but also increases user interaction and involvement through community incentives and governance participation. The use of the token further extends to the areas of risk management and investment appreciation, providing users with more usage scenarios and potential value growth.

It is important to note that holding $BTI tokens does not imply ownership of any additional rights, such as equity, dividends, or statutory claims. All permissions related to $BTI tokens are limited to the scope of application within the BTI platform, and users implement various functions and interactions within the platform by holding and using $BTI tokens. In this way, the BTI platform cleverly combines the principles of token economics with the practical requirements of a digital platform, creating a more cohesive and efficient ecosystem for users.

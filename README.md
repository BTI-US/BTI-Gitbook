## Abstract

In the rapidly developing and popularizing digital currency market, futures investors face various risks, including market volatility, counterparty default, and technical failures. To address these challenges, this white paper introduces the BTI platform â€” an innovative smart insurance platform for contract trading. We aim to use smart contract technology to provide investors with an automated, efficient, and unique protection mechanism.

The BTI platform is committed to establishing a secure, reliable, and transparent decentralized contract trading compensation platform. By introducing a blockchain-based smart insurance compensation mechanism, we provide robust risk protection for virtual currency futures investors. Smart contracts will automatically monitor and respond to market conditions, ensuring rapid compensation in the event of market fluctuations, counterparty default, or technical failures, thereby mitigating potential losses for investors.

Our goal is to reduce uncertainty in trading and enhance investor confidence, promoting stable development in the entire virtual currency market. The platform will continue to innovate and improve, dedicated to providing investors with more comprehensive, efficient, and secure smart insurance services, aiming to be a leader in the field of virtual currency contract trading.

This white paper provides a clear framework for the BTI platform, covering its main features, technical implementation, and future development directions. It presents our core concepts, characteristics, and objectives from a comprehensive yet concise perspective.

2. **Investors**: To ensure the stable development and healthy operation of the ecosystem, team, and equity user tokens will be locked for 3 years.
3. **Initial Airdrop and Sign-in**: This will be distributed during the seed round auction.

⚠️ **Important Note**: Web2 logins will not receive airdrops or win rewards from activities.

# How to Get BTI Tokens Early

## Seed Round Auction Purchase

To attract active users, build a strong user base, and enhance the market visibility of the BTI platform, we are about to hold a special seed round auction event before officially opening our insurance services. This event aims to provide our early supporters with an exclusive opportunity to purchase $BTI tokens at a favorable price and the chance to experience our upcoming insurance feature in advance.

Besides promotion and market recognition purposes, this event also plays a key role in technical testing. Users who participate in the low-cost purchase event and gain access to the insurance feature will become our platform's beta testers. They will not only be the first to experience our innovative insurance service but will also provide us with valuable real data. This data is crucial for us; it will help ensure the effectiveness and reliability of our insurance feature, laying a solid foundation for the smooth launch and stable operation of the platform.

Through this event, we look forward to working together with our early supporters to participate in the growth of the BTI platform. We aim to ensure that our services have been thoroughly tested and optimized before officially opening to the public, meeting the needs and expectations of our users.

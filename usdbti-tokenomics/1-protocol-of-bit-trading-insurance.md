# Protocol of Bit Trading Insurance

## Token Protocol

BTI is a blockchain-based protocol consisting of off-chain and on-chain components (smart contracts) and is based on the Semaphore framework of the Ethereum PSE group. The protocol enforces the value appreciation of tokens through a prohibition on selling and empowers the tokens to achieve the goal of propagation through holder address splitting.

## Current Status

The protocol was initially deployed on Polygon during the testing phase and the current version runs on Ethereum with a highly scalable batch-processing architecture. Bridges have been established for state changes on Optimism and Polygon PoS on Ethereum, and each batch insertion is replicated on these chains. As of the time of writing this article, simulations have been attempted with a limit of 3000 addresses.

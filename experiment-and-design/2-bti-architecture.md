    A --> E
    A --> F
```

In the context of a WordPress-powered site, the frontend structure and styling are managed primarily through the theme's template files and functions.

**1.1.1. WordPress Theme Header (header.php)**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html <?php language_attributes(); ?>>
<head>
    <meta charset="<?php bloginfo( 'charset' ); ?>">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <title><?php bloginfo('name'); ?> | <?php is_front_page() ? bloginfo('description') : wp_title(''); ?></title>
    <?php wp_head(); ?>
</head>
```

The header template (**`header.php`**) in WordPress defines the document type and head section. It includes the site's character encoding, viewport settings, dynamic title tag, and the **`wp_head()`** function to enqueue theme styles and scripts.

**1.1.2. WordPress Navigation Menu**

```html
<body <?php body_class(); ?>>
    <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-custom">
        <?php if ( has_custom_logo() ) : ?>
            <?php the_custom_logo(); ?>
        <?php else : ?>
            <a class="navbar-brand" href="<?php echo home_url(); ?>"><?php bloginfo('name'); ?></a>
        <?php endif; ?>
        <?php
        wp_nav_menu( array(
            'theme_location' => 'primary',
            'container' => 'div',
            'container_class' => 'collapse navbar-collapse',
            'menu_class' => 'navbar-nav mr-auto',
        ) );
        ?>
    </nav>
```

The navigation menu in WordPress is typically implemented using **`wp_nav_menu()`**, which dynamically generates a menu based on user-defined locations and settings in the WordPress admin area.

**1.1.3. WordPress Main Content Area (index.php, page.php, single.php, etc.)**

```html
<div class="container">
    <?php if ( have_posts() ) : while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?>
        <h1><?php the_title(); ?></h1>
        <?php the_content(); ?>
    <?php endwhile; endif; ?>
</div>
```

**1.1.4. WordPress Footer (footer.php)**

```html
<footer class="text-center text-lg-start bg-light text-muted">
    <section class="d-flex justify-content-center justify-content-lg-between p-4 border-bottom">
        <?php dynamic_sidebar('footer-1'); ?>
    </section>
    <?php wp_footer(); ?>
</footer>
</body>
</html>
```

The footer (**`footer.php`**) often includes dynamic sidebars for widgets and the **`wp_footer()`** function, which is crucial for enqueuing additional scripts and performing necessary actions by WordPress plugins and themes.

**1.1.5. WordPress Enqueued Scripts and Styles (functions.php)**

In WordPress, JavaScript libraries and stylesheets are typically enqueued in the **`functions.php`** file of the theme using the **`wp_enqueue_script()`** and **`wp_enqueue_style()`** functions. This practice ensures proper loading and dependency management.

```php
function bti_enqueue_scripts() {
    wp_enqueue_style('bootstrap', 'https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css', array(), '4.3.1');
    wp_enqueue_script('jquery');
    wp_enqueue_script('popper', 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js', array(), '1.14.7', true);
    wp_enqueue_script('bootstrap-js', 'https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js', array('jquery', 'popper'), '4.3.1', true);
